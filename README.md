# PHP Coursework 1 - Online Bookstore

PHP coursework implementing a simple online bookstore using arrays, functions (pass-by-reference), POST forms, file logging, and HTML output.

## Features
- Book inventory management with associative arrays
- Genre-based discounts (Science Fiction: 10%, Fantasy: 5%)
- Form validation and sanitization
- File logging with timestamps, IP, and user agent
- Live log file display (bonus feature)

## How to run

**Where to place files:**  
Place all project files in your local server’s web root (e.g. `htdocs/bookstore/` or `www/bookstore/`). For AMPPS, use `www/bookstore/` under the AMPPS install directory.

**Which file to open:**  
Open in your browser:  
`http://localhost/bookstore/index.php`

Ensure `bookstore_log.txt` is writable by the web server so logging works.
